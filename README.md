**Python Dependencies**
streamlit==1.27.0        # For browser-based UI
opencv-python==4.8.1.78  # For image processing
scikit-learn==1.3.1      # For KMeans clustering

>Notes

The number of dominant colors can be adjusted by changing the k parameter in the get_dominant_colors function.

This app works best for images with a moderate number of distinct colors.

use_container_width=True is used to make the uploaded image responsive.
